write function to  add 2 numbers in python ,"Certainly! Here's a simple Python function that adds two numbers together.

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    """"""
    Returns the sum of two numbers
    """"""
    return a + b
```

You can call this function by passing in two numbers as arguments like this:

```python
result = add_numbers(3, 4)
print(result)
```

This will output `7`, which is the sum of 3 and 4.",,,2023-06-22 00:13:53.415010
